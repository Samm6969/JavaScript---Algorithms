//This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. 
//But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.
//Here are some helpful links:
    //String.prototype.substr()
    //String.prototype.substring()

function confirmEnding(str, target) {
